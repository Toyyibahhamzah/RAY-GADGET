## Data Modelling

One fact table and five dimension tables were created, which included the Calendar table aimed at enhancing the data model's performance through the utilization of DAX functions.
Each dimension table's PRIMARY KEYS were linked to the corresponding FOREIGN KEYS in the fact table, establishing a one-to-many relationship.
This model follows a star schema data model.
